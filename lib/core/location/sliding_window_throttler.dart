/// Pure-Dart sliding-window rate limiter used by the rider app's
/// [LocationUploader] (Task 8.4).
///
/// Property 3 (R17.4): for any sliding 60-second window, the number of
/// accepted samples must not exceed the rate budget for the profile in
/// force at the end of that window. `SlidingWindowThrottler` is the
/// executable form of that property — it is a plain data structure
/// with no timers or streams; the caller decides "now".
///
/// Usage:
///
/// ```dart
/// final throttler = SlidingWindowThrottler(
///   window: AppConstants.locationRateWindow,
///   initialBudget: AppConstants.locationBudgetWaitingPerMinute,
/// );
/// if (throttler.canEmit(now)) {
///   await uploader.send(sample);
///   throttler.accept(now);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The state-change semantics are deliberate: when the profile
/// tightens (e.g., from `waitingOnline` to `inTransitToCustomer`), the
/// budget grows; when it relaxes, the budget shrinks. We do NOT clear
/// existing stamps on [setBudget] because the property is over the past
/// 60 seconds regardless of when the budget changed.
