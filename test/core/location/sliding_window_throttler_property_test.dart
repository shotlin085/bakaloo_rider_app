/// Feature: grolin-rider-app, Property 3:
/// For any sliding 60-second window, count(uploads) <= Rate_Budget(state).
///
/// We model an arbitrary event trace as a list of `(deltaMs, budget)`
/// pairs where each pair represents a candidate emit. The simulator:
/// 1. Advances simulated time by `deltaMs`.
/// 2. Sets the throttler's budget (so the simulator captures
///    profile-tightening + profile-relaxing transitions).
/// 3. Asks the throttler whether the emit is permitted at the new time.
/// 4. If yes, accepts the emit.
///
/// At every accepted timestamp we then assert that the count of accepted
/// timestamps within the last 60s does not exceed the *maximum* budget
/// observed during the window. The strongest practical statement of the
/// design's invariant: over any sub-window where the budget is constant,
/// the count is bounded by that constant; over the whole window, by the
/// maximum constant held during the window.
///
/// Validates: Requirements R17.4.
